# Definition and usage

This is a simple plugin allowing you to play any game emote, regardless of whether it has been unlocked or not.
It is as simple as typing the usual emote command in chat.
This is not an unlock cheat and is client side only, therefore, other people won't see your emotes and nothing will be sent to the server.

After enabling the plugin, you can type /bypassemote or /be to open the configuration window.
On the configuration window, you will be able to disable the plugin for yourself, which means the plugin will not play any emote for you anymore, and locked emotes will not be applied.
It will however keep IPC enabled, meaning any other plugin using BypassEmote's functions will still work. Meaning that, if you were to use a purely hypothetical syncing tool, you would still be able to see other people's emote, but they wouldn't apply to you, if you do not want to play any emote yourself but still want to see others'.
You can also choose to automatically face your target, if any, when using an emote. However, this is using the face target command, making you **follow** your target continuously, instead of facing it once and for all.
